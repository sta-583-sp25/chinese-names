# Introduction

Consider the names Lily and Susan. The former is an example of a lexical name, one which consists of words or concepts that are directly interpretable in a context other than that of a name (e.g., the lily flower). The latter is an example of an onomastic name, one which is thought of almost exclusively in terms of its meaning as a name (even though its etymology derives from the Persian word for lily flower). In English, many more names are onomastic (e.g., David, Megan, or Jessica) compared to lexical (e.g., Brook, Hunter, or Grace).

In contrast, the vast majority of Chinese given names may be considered lexical simply due to the fact that they are comprised of characters which themselves have lexical value [1]. For instance, the characters 梦瑶, although recognizably a common female name, consists of the characters 梦 and 瑶 which have meanings of “dream” and “jade,” respectively. Thus, while it may be strange to have a name in English that contains the words “dream” and “jade,” this common name in Chinese does just that. Because of the lexical nature of Chinese names, it is possible to examine their “feeling.” For instance, male given names which contain the characters 勇 (brave) or 强 (strong) might have a different “feeling” than names containing 儒 (scholar) or 敏 (smart). A name containing the character 保 (protect) might feel “warmer” than a name containing the character 吓 (frighten).

The Resident Identity Card (居民身份证) is an identification card issued to citizens of the People’s Republic of China. Information contained in the card includes things such as name and date of birth. [2]. Because the card is an integral part of daily life, being the only acceptable legal instrument mandated for activities such as opening bank accounts, obtaining phone numbers, driving licenses, etc., most citizens have a Resident Identity Card. As part of a 21st century initiative to combat issues related to identify fraud, data from the Resident Identity Card were compiled in The National Citizen Identity Information Center of the People’s Republic of China (全国公民身份证号码查询服务中心), which now maintains the world’s largest identity database, with over 1.3 billion entries [3].
Project objectives

This data provided come from the ChineseNames R package maintained by Bao (2021) [4] and are available [here](https://github.com/psychbruce/ChineseNames). The data comprise aggregated counts at the character level using data from the National Citizen Identitiy Information Center from 1930 to 2008, with extremely rare characters removed to maintain privacy. A team of researchers rated over 2,600 characters used in common names on valence, warmth, and competence [5].

# Project objectives

The overall objectives are the following:

- Evaluate whether there is evidence of differential impressions of characters used in given names between males and females. If so, where do these differences lie?
- Are there any patterns through time? Are there any interesting trends or patterns you observe in the data that may be best captured visually?
